# Breast Cancer Classification Project

## Introduction
Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world.  Machine learning has been used as a technique to help classify cancerous tumors as 'benign' or 'malignant' based on certain attributes.  For this project, I will analyze the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.  The set has 569 entries with 32 variables.  The data can be obtained from the UCI Repository found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) or imported through the pre-programmed datasets in Python.  The goal of this project is to create the best model in order to classify a randomized tumor as benign (no cancer) or malignant (cancer present).  The following libraries will be used for this analysis:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaboarn
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
